            <h2 HAPPY 10TH MONTHSARY TO US </h2>

            <p>Sometimes words can’t capture the depth of my feelings for you, but I hope this message gives you a glimpse into my heart. I love you with every fiber of my body and soul. The feeling of being destined for you is so strong, and I don't think anyone else would ever make me feel as special as you do. I would do everything to spend time with you, see your smile, and just hug and kiss you lots, just like we used to do. I love you very much, and I want to spend all of my time with you. I want you to marry me. I want us to have a family soon. I want to grow old with you. I know sometimes we don't get alone, but I want us to work out, communicate, and go through everything together because I can't imagine myself living properly without you because you have really become a part of my life. You are a special person that I can count on whenever everything is falling apart. Someone who supports me, being one of my biggest inspirations in school, career, and everything else. I love you so much.</p>
